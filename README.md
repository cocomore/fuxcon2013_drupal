FUxCon 2013 // Drupal
======================

Implementation of a project site as demonstrated at the FUxCon 2013 workshop.
This particular implementation is based on Drupal 7.x. Drupal and the required modules
are  not included in this repository but are downloaded and merged with our custom code
during the installation process.

As a quick start, 

1. Set up a MySQL database "fuxcon2013_drupal" and create a database user "fuxcon" with password "fuxcon" for it.

2. Run the script install.sh in this directory. 

3. Set up a web server with PHP 5.3 and point its document root at 

  <this directory>/drupal

4. Access the website through your browser 

Please refer to our website http://cocomore.github.io/fuxcon2013 for background information. You may also want to try the disk image with a minimal Debian Linux system we provide through this website. This image has all four framework implementations and all necessary software pre-installed.

Happy coding,
Olav Schettler // Cocomore AG
